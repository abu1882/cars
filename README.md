## Technology stack
- back-end: Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Data, JPA with Hibernate, embedded H2 Database, Lombok, Logback
- testing: Spock
- building: gradle, Travis
- code quality: JaCoCo, coveralls

## Disclaimer
All Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are turn on and are available at server port. It is convenience when testing,
but not recommended in production.
